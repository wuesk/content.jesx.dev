# "Hello world"

## Internet kid
I've loved computers since I was a child. No seriously - I was playing video games at 3 years old. We had Internet even, it was expensive back then but my dad used it for work. I used to have bad dreams as a kid that Internet went out (lol). The game on the photo is [Troy 2000](https://www.saitogames.com/troy2000/).

Like every kid growing up on the Internet, I spent probably thousands of hours ***surfing*** the web. Blogs, forums and flash games - it was so cool back then. I loved playing the games on LEGOs website and reading blogs about video games I liked (Rayman and Sonic, mostly). I always wanted to be a part of it, so eventually, I made a small blog about Tamagotchis.

## First code ever
When I was around 11 or 12 I wanted to start making my own video games. I started to learn [Processing](https://processing.org/) which is a Java-based language and IDE that allowed to create electronic arts in a simple way - a good start for me. I started with Pong, my second game was Snake, and my biggest feat was a platformer game. Sadly, I don't have any copies of the games anymore.

## Minecraft era
Like many kids, I played Minecraft a lot. I was admin on some servers, so I learned a lot about managing servers and coding plugins. One of my favorite aspects of Minecraft was working with redstone, which is analogous to circuitry in the real world. Redstone allowed players to create complex "electronic" systems using logic gates, such as automated lighting systems for buildings.

Experimenting with redstone taught me the fundamentals of logic, which was very usefull in understanding how computers work.

## University
A lot of year passed since then. As a teenager and a student, I mostly played video games because school was very tiring for me, and I had no motivation to learn new things.

Eventually, I finished Engineering in Computer Science and later got Masters Degree. Now here I am with all the time in the world to learn new things.

## Real developer?

Currently I'm working as a Software Engineer in huge company. Corporate software can be monotonous, so I want to work on my own projects. This blog is my return to the basics of the Internet and computers. I want to be part of this virtual world, build my own software that will be **FUN** to use.

## The plan
My plan for upcoming years is to learn more languages and frameworks, earn some money, leave the corporate work, and focus on my hobbies. One day I want to release my own video game. Or maybe multiple ones? We'll see.
